BC6: Work with ChatGPT like Tony Stark works with JARVIS
Effectively using an artificial intelligence (AI) tool like ChatGPT involves understanding that you have a thinking partner, not something that will do things for you. The quality of the response depends on the question and how you collaboratively develop the conversation, making corrections, asking for clarifications, requesting initial connections between concepts, step-by-step instructions, and the "logic" behind each step.
How can you apply this idea to your daily life?
Some tips for applying this approach in your daily work with tools like ChatGPT include:
Treat ChatGPT as a collaborator rather than a substitute.
Engage in two-way communication, asking questions, making corrections, and providing guidance to improve responses.
Be specific in your instructions.
Do not expect the tool to make decisions; use it to enrich your own perspectives and knowledge.
Possibilities and limitations
Tools like ChatGPT can help you with a wide range of tasks, such as:
Content creation: writing blog posts, social media updates, or advertising copy.
Research: gathering and synthesizing information from various sources.
Brainstorming: developing new ideas, strategies, or product concepts.
Document assistance: outlining, editing, and proofreading reports, proposals, or presentations.
It's also important to be aware of the limitations:
Knowledge limited to the information available when the tool was last trained.
Inability to think and reason like a human.
Risks and how to manage them
When working with tools like ChatGPT, be aware of the risks and learn to manage them:
Do not take responses as absolute truths; verify the information and consider the context.
Maintain control of strategic decisions; use AI as a complementary resource.
AI tools like ChatGPT have enormous potential for businesses when used effectively. By adopting a collaborative approach, understanding their limitations, and managing risks, professionals can harness the power of AI to improve productivity and drive innovation.

Business Cyborgs
Enhancing the capabilities of businesspeople with technology
What is a cyborg?
A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, meaning a living being that incorporates exogenous components to extend the self-regulating control function of the organism to adapt to new environments and improve its capabilities.
Why Business Cyborgs?
The environment in which businesses operate is rapidly changing, and those who adapt to change succeed.
The wave of change we are riding is the ability of all people with access to electronic devices to give natural language (written or oral) commands and get results. Devices like computers, cell phones, tablets, smart glasses, and others can produce answers to people's questions, texts for writing emails and other forms of text, and even have conversations in which the person develops their ideas.

Soon everyone will have the possibility to have intelligent assistants, imagine your own Iron Man's Jarvis without being a multimillionaire playboy with an energy core embedded in your chest covered in an exoskeleton.
Microsoft describes this idea with a powerful metaphor: the copilot. Copilots in multiple aspects of life.

Time for businesspeople seems to never be enough, so they leverage others, prioritize, and use technology. The day is not enough to achieve everything one wants, and many people spend time on tasks:

Relatively mundane tasks that consume time and energy. Tasks that do not take advantage of the person's talent and creativity.
Communicating their vision to collaborators and reviewing their work until they achieve what the person has in mind.
Shifting from the role of "creators" to one of editors. Creators of documents, presentations, emails, and other day-to-day tasks of businesspeople.

In other words, too much time is spent tightening screws when the greatest value lies in knowing which screw to tighten.

What are Business Cyborgs?
Business Cyborgs are individuals who leverage technology to dramatically increase their capabilities, thus developing their roles and freeing up time and energy to focus on activities that generate more value, whether for the organization or for themselves.

Why become a Business Cyborg?
To achieve what you desire in less time, using fewer resources while increasing impact.
